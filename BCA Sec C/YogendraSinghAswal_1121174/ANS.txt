Security, in information technology (IT), is the defense of digital information and IT assets against internal and external, malicious and accidental threats. This defense includes detection, prevention and response to threats through the use of security policies, software tools and IT services. Security is critical for enterprises and organizations of all sizes and in all industries. Weak security can result in compromised systems or data, either by a malicious threat actor or an unintentional internal threat. Not meeting security standards that are regulated by a separate organization or law, such as PCI DSS 3.0 or HIPAA compliance, can also result in financial penalties.
